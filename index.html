    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hello! I am Xiaocao Lu, a biotechnology master’s student at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. My academic background integrates biotechnology, sustainable tourism, and hospitality management, with research interests in consumer behavior, health-related decision making, and interdisciplinary applications of data analysis.

I got the dual bachelor’s degree from Hainan University and Arizona State University, followed by a Master degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong majoring in Sustainable Tourism.

My research experience includes serving as a Research Assistant at Hainan University, where I conducted literature reviews, supported quantitative research design, and performed data analysis for marketing and consumer behavior studies. I co-authored a peer-reviewed publication in the International Journal of Tourism Research examining post-pandemic travel intentions and health belief factors.

Beyond academia, I have professional experience in market development and scientific product promotion in the biotechnology industry. My work combines analytical thinking with practical problem-solving, and I am particularly interested in bridging research insights with real-world applications.
